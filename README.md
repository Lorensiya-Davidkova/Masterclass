# Masterclass - MyWebApp
Here are all exercises from Java Programming Masterclass updated on Java 17 | Udemy
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on the target computer:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): To compile and run Java applications.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA (optional but recommended).
- MySQL Server (or any other database server of your choice): To set up the database for the application.
Step 1: Clone the Repository
* 		Clone the project repository containing the Spring Boot web application to the target computer.
* 		You can do this using Git by running the following command in the terminal:  Code: git clone <repository_url>		  
Step 2: Configure the Database
* 		Make sure MySQL Server is installed and running on the target computer.
* 		Create a new database for the application using a MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench or command-line).
* 		Inside the project, locate the application.properties file (usually in the src/main/resources directory) and update the database connection settings (database URL, username, password) to match your newly created database.
Step 3: Build the Application
* 		Open your preferred IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA) on the target computer.
* 		Import the project into the IDE as a Maven or Gradle project (depending on your project setup).
* 		Once the project is loaded, navigate to the root folder of the Java web application project.
* 		Build the project to resolve dependencies and compile the code.
Step 4: Run the Application
* 		In the IDE, find the main class of your Spring Boot application (usually annotated with @SpringBootApplication) In this case: MyWebApp
* 		Right-click on the main class and select "Run" to start the application.
Step 5: Test the Application
* 		Once the application is running, open a web browser on the target computer.
* 		Enter the URL http://localhost:8080 to access the Spring Boot web application.
* 		Interact with the application and test its functionality.
